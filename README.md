# W1X Debloat


## What is W1X Debloat?
W1X Debloat is a small PowerShell script compiled into an executable for easier access.  I initially created this script for myself when I would re-image my computer and had to turn off all the annoying bloatware that Microsoft included.

The script optimizes your Windows 10 or Windows 11 computer to remove all bloatware and increase performance.
